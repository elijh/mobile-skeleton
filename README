A skeleton smartphone app using jquery mobile and persistence.

To try it locally in the browser, open index.html in Chrome.

Chrome is the browser of choice for HTML-based smartphone apps, because
it is most similar to the webkit found in Android and iOS. 

This sample app is designed to work without the need to run a local
webserver. Because Chrome does not allow javascript to load local files, 
all the content and script used for the application must be specified in
the index.html file. This makes the design of the app more awkward, but
allows people to test an app without running a local webserver.

To customize this app, edit these files:

seed.js
  This file should contain a JSON dump of the data you want to 
  seed the database with. It should set the variable 'seed'.

app.js
  This file contains all your application code.

index.html
  This file contains your HTML.
